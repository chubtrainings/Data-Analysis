ORA-00942 because of the foreign key reference, not because of the SALES table itself.

Let’s break it down clearly 👇

❌ Root Cause (Very Common Oracle Issue)
FOREIGN KEY (PROD_ID) REFERENCES PRODUCTS(PRODUCT_ID)


Oracle is saying:

I cannot see a table called PRODUCTS in your current schema (AKS)
OR you don’t have privileges on it.

Since your current user is AKS, Oracle looks for:

AKS.PRODUCTS


If that table does not exist, or exists in another schema, you get ORA-00942.
