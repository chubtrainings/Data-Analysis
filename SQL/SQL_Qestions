Basic Level (Beginner)

1. What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to
interact with relational databases. It is used to store, retrieve, update, and delete
data. SQL is also used to create and modify database structures such as tables,
views, and indexes.
Example:

SELECT * FROM Employees;
This query retrieves all the records from the Employees table.
2. What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed
electronically. It allows users to efficiently store, retrieve, update, and manage
data. Databases are used to handle large amounts of information in various
applications such as websites, business systems, and applications.
Example:
A customer database in an e-commerce website may store customer details like

name, email, contact number, and purchase history.

3, What are the types of SQL commands?
SQL commands are categorized into five types based on their functionality:
1. DDL (Data Definition Language) — Defines the structure of the database.
« CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
2.DML (Data Manipulation Language) — Manages data stored in the database.
« SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
3. DCL (Data Control Language) ~ Controls access to the data,
« GRANT, REVOKE
4. TCL (Transaction Control Language) ~ Manages transactions in the
database,
» COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
5.DQL (Data Query Language) ~ Retrieves data from the database.

4, What is Primary Key?

A Primary Key isa column or a combination of columns ina table that uniquely identifies
values.

Key Featur

+ Uniquely identifies each record

+ Cannot have duy

+ Cannot contain NULL values
+ Only one primary key is allowed per table

Employees (
EnployeeID
Name

Her

Foreign Key?
is a column or combination of columns in one table that refers to the Primary
{Key in another table. It is used to create a relationship between two tables and enforce
referential integrity
Key Fi
+ Establishes a relationship between two tables

+ Can contain dupli ues

+ Can accept NULL values,
Example:

DepartmentID in the Employees table is a foreign key that references the
DepartmentID column in the Departments tabl


What is UNIQUE Key?
A UNIQUE Key is a constraint that ensures all values in a column or combination of
columns are distinet across all rows in the table, It prevents duplicate values but allows
NULL values (only one NULL value in most databases).
Key Features:
+ Ensures uniqueness of each record in the column
+ Allo NULL value (depending on the databa
+ Multiple UNIQUE keys can be defined ina table

+ Helps maintain data integrity

Employees (
EmployeeID
Email. VARCHAR(a

Name VARCHAR(5€)

Here, the Email column has a UNIQUE constrain no two employees can have the
email add

7. What is the Difference Between Primary Key and UNIQUE

Key?

What is NOT NULL Constraint?
The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column cannot have NULL values. It is used to
enforce that every row must have a value in that column,
Key Features:
+ Prevents insertion of NULL values
+ Ensures mandatory fields have data
+ Can be applied to one or more columns.
Example:

In this example, the Name column cannot have NULL values, while the Email column can
accept NULL values.

9, What is Default Constraint?

The Default Constraint provides a default value for a column when no value is spe
during the insertion of a new record.

Key Features

+ Automatically assigns a default value if no value is provided

fied

+ Helps avoid NULL values in specific columns
+ Can be applied to any data type
Example:

Employees (

In this example, if no salary is provided while inserting a record, the Salary
column will automatically be set to 5000.
