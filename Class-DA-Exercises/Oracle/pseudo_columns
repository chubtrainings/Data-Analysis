In Oracle, pseudo columns are called so because they behave like table columns in SQL queries but are not actually stored as columns in the table.

Why they are called Pseudo columns

Pseudo means false or not real.

Oracle pseudo columns:

Look like columns → you can SELECT, WHERE, and sometimes ORDER BY them

Are not physically stored in the table

Are generated dynamically by Oracle at query runtime

Do not appear in DESC table_name

Cannot be INSERTed or UPDATEd (with very few exceptions)

So they are column-like, but not real table columns → hence pseudo columns.

Simple definition

Pseudo columns are special, system-generated values provided by Oracle that act like columns but do not exist in the table definition.

Common Oracle pseudo columns and their purpose
Pseudo Column	Purpose
ROWNUM	Assigns a number to each row returned by a query
ROWID	Physical address of a row in the database
LEVEL	Used in hierarchical queries
SYSDATE	Current date & time (technically a function, often grouped conceptually)
UID	User ID of the current user
CURRVAL, NEXTVAL	Sequence-generated values
ORA_ROWSCN	System Change Number of last modification
Example to understand why it's pseudo
Table definition
DESC employees;


Output:

EMP_ID
NAME
SALARY


No ROWNUM here.

But you can still query it
SELECT emp_id, name, ROWNUM
FROM employees;


✔ ROWNUM behaves like a column
❌ But it does not exist in the table

Key characteristics (exam-friendly points)

Generated at query execution time

Not stored in the database

Read-only

Used mainly for internal processing, filtering, and query logic

Cannot be indexed

Why Oracle uses pseudo columns

To provide row-level metadata

To enable efficient internal operations

To avoid storing redundant data

To support advanced SQL features (pagination, hierarchy, concurrency)

One-line interview answer

Pseudo columns in Oracle are system-generated values that act like columns in SQL queries but are not physically stored in the table, which is why they are called pseudo columns.

If you want, I can also explain ROWNUM vs ROWID, real columns vs pseudo columns, or exam questions with answers.
