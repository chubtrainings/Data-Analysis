1️⃣. SELECT Statement: This is the most basic SQL command used to retrieve data from a database. With the SELECT statement, you specify the columns you want to retrieve data from and the table where the data resides. It allows you to filter, sort, and manipulate data using various clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, etc.

2️⃣. Aggregate Functions: Aggregate functions allow you to perform calculations on sets of values. Commonly used aggregate functions include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX. These functions are often used in combination with the SELECT statement to perform statistical analysis and summarize data.

3️⃣ . JOINs: JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of JOINs such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, each serving a different purpose in data analysis. Understanding how to use JOINs effectively is crucial for fetching data from multiple tables and performing complex analyses.

4️⃣. Subqueries: Subqueries, also known as nested queries or inner queries, are queries nested within another query. They are used to retrieve data based on criteria evaluated from another query's results. Subqueries can be employed in various ways, such as filtering data, performing calculations, or even acting as a table in JOIN operations. Mastery of subqueries can significantly enhance the flexibility and depth of your SQL data analysis.

5️⃣. Common Table Expressions (CTEs): CTEs are temporary named result sets that exist only within the execution scope of a single SQL statement. They allow you to break down complex queries into smaller, more readable, and maintainable parts. CTEs are particularly useful for recursive queries, hierarchical data, and when you need to reference the same subquery multiple times within a larger SQL query.
